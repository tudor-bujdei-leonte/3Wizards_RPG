--- Gameplay ---

The three wizards are facing the dangers of Deep Dungeon. They need your help to plan their moves so they can advance.

Press "play" or "load game" and jump right in. Each wave is a 3v3 fight, with consecutive waves getting progressively harder. Check the currently attacking and the next attacking player in the bottom right corner.
When it is your turn, you will be presented with one of three choices: 
 - "Attack" deals a basic attack
 - "Heal" gives a defence-based heal to the lowest-hp ally
 - "Special" does the special AoE of the wizard.



--- Allies & Enemies ---

Magic wizard - The sturdy man. He is best at taking one for the team and buffs the defence for all allies.

Ice wizard - The support. He specialises in providing support for the team in the form of buffs and debuffs - attack up, defence down, attack down, freeze.

Fire wizard - The damage dealer. He is on the offensive, boasting a large attack stat and interrupting enemies' heals. Be careful though, he is not great at sustaining damage!

Enemies - each wave will have you facing 3 out of 24 possible enemies, divided in 7 classes based on their offensive and defensive stats.



--- Effects ---

Attack buff - Increases attack by 50%
Defence break - Decreases defence by 50%
Attack break - Decreases attack by 50%
Freeze - Cannot attack for one turn

--- Issues ---

When all mages die to a cheat enemy attack, the score will not be saved.
When upwards of 2GB ram is used, the game will crash due to insufficient tkinter memory allocation.
